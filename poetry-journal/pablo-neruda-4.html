            <h2>My Reflections</h2>
            <!-- Insert your journal entry text here -->
            <p>	This is poem 4 of Pablo Neruda’s Veinte Poemas de Amor y una Canción Desesperada, called The Morning is Full. The poem starts off with two contrasting ideas: summer and stormy, atrocious weather. Summer signifies playful, happy, exciting, and motivating emotions. In contrast, a storm evokes bleak, draining, and depressing feelings.
                We’ve all felt the disappointment of being excited for summer day plans, only to be met with a storm that ruins everything. The joy of that anticipated day is taken away by the storm. I think this poem uses the storm as a metaphor for the absence of something within the author. For him, it could represent a lack of love and intimacy.
                Pablo Neruda describes love as being silenced by the raging winds around him. He mentions how the wind is full of wars and songs, which shows that the wind, in the context of a storm, removes beauty. In a different context, such as a windy but sunny day, the wind could feel peaceful.
                Neruda also describes how the wind brushes away the dead leaves but also pushes away the birds. This could symbolize change and growth that the wind brings. Finally, the poem ends with a storm passing over with a kiss, which almost suggests that after the storm, summer is still present.
                This could mean that although love and intimacy may be absent, the memories remain. As Bad Bunny said, “Si hay que enamorarnos de nuevo, nos volvemo a enamorar. Tú sabes que a mí me gusta estar así, enamorao,” meaning that if we are meant to fall in love again, we will. He knows he likes to be in love.
                Basically, the author hints that even though the absence of love is being felt, the door remains open for love to return. I personally can relate to this. Someone who was once super special to you, who you spoke with every day, can suddenly become a complete stranger.
                The line that I felt the most is “heart of the wind beating above our loving silence.” For me, that line hits home. Life keeps moving forward, and with the constant buzz of work, school, career, health, and everything else, having to love in silence while constantly thinking about someone, while also wondering if they think about you, is painful.
                But as the poem suggests, life, like the wind, moves forward quickly. It can guide you toward becoming a better version of yourself, if you allow time to heal you. I think that right now, even though the love is silent, I am letting the wind brush away the dead leaves and trying to be a better person every day, or at least I try to be. I am also trying, as Pablo said, to let the summer continue and keep the door open, instead of letting the storm rage on.
