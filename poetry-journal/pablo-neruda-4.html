            <h2>My Reflections</h2>
            <!-- Insert your journal entry text here -->
            <p>	This is poem 4 of Pablo Neruda’s “Veinte Poemas de amor y una canción desesperada” called The Morning is Full. The poem starts off with two contrasting ideas: summer and stormy atrocious weather. Summer signifies playful, happy, exciting, motivating emotions, but it contrasts with a storm. Bleak, life sucking, depressing emotions are felt when depicting a storm. We’ve all felt the disappointment of being excited for a summer’s day plans only to be met with a horrifying storm that ruins your day. The absence of that summer’s day is taken away from you by the storm. I think this poem uses the storm as a metaphor of the absence of something in the author. For the author it could be love and intimacy. Pablo Neruda describes love as silent being silenced by the raging winds around and how the wind is also full of wars and songs showing how the wind is sort of taking away the beauty due to the context being a storm because a windy sunny could be peaceful in that context. Neruda also goes into more depth about the wind and how it brushes away the dead leaves but also pushes away the birds. This could signify some sort of change and growth coming from the wind. Finally, the poem ends with a storm passing over with a kiss almost signifying how at the end of the storm summer is still there. This could mean although the love and intimacy was absent the memories are and will still be there and as bad bunny said “Si hay que enamorarnos de nuevo, nos volvemo a enamorar
                Tú sabes que a mí me gusta estar así, enamorao” meaning that if we are meant to fall in love again we will know I like to be like that, in love. Basically the author hints that although the absence is there and being felt the door is still there to be opened once again. I personally can relate to this, someone super special to you talking everyday to one day complete strangers. The line that I felt the most is “heart of the wind beating above our loving silence”, for me that line hits home. With life continuously moving forward and the buzz with work, school, career, health, etc having to love in silence and think about them all the time while also wondering if they think about you is painful in a way. But like the poem states life like the wind moves forward fast and can push you to a better person you were before if you allow time to heal you. I think right now even though the love is silent I am letting the wind brush the dead leaves and trying to be a better person everyday or at least I try to be. I am also trying to like Pablo said to let the summer continue and always leave that door open not let the storm rage on.
