            <p>	Initially I did not understand the poem. It took me a couple of reads before I fully could comprehend it in my own way. I’m not sure if this is exactly what Pablo Neruda intended, but this is what I extrapolated. A big theme in this poem is the contrast between light and dark, and life and death. It’s actually interesting because I guess what the author conveys is that at night the person is themselves full of light. I got this from the third paragraph when things began to make sense. When the night comes out the things that they were hiding come out, their true selves are out in the open. Their true selves are capable of nurturing a whole town and create new creations that sprout flowers out of them. However a big key is that they are only like this in the dark. In the first paragraph they have a mortal flame that light wraps around them however the darkness of the twilight swirls around them. For me this shows that they are deeply sad and incapable of being themselves or at least they feel like they can’t. Because in the end they create all these vibrant living things around them and yet they are filled and fuel by sadness. I think a lot of us can relate to this loneliness that we don’t feel like we can fully be ourselves but at night everything we dream of is possible. What’s extremely beautiful is that even with all this sadness their light never diminishes, their life never expires, they still move forward. This poem touches me because some of the most beautiful souls I’ve met have been subjected to the worst treatment and feel as though they should not be themselves. I wish they could see the flame I see in them and how inspiring they are to me and how inspiring they can be to others. I hope one day they can fuel their own light. </p>
