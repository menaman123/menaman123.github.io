            <h2>My Reflections</h2>
            <!-- Insert your journal entry text here -->
            <p>	This poem describes a calm tranquil love. Oftentimes love is pictured as exhilarating and addicting. 
                However, Pablo Neruda here is describing a love that brings you down to earth that makes you cherish 
                the little things in life. Kinda perfect timing as Earth day was a few days ago. The first paragraph 
                transports you to the middle of the woods. Closing your eyes you can just imagine the wind traveling 
                across the thick tree branches giving off a calming sound. The breeze is so calming that nothing matters 
                in that moment but that moment. That type of peace love can bring is something special. Someone who can 
                make you forget about the stresses of lige and be content with the now is truly special. Later on in the poem, 
                the author describes letting the love with the person carry him through life. This level of trust is truly special, 
                that only a true peace coming from that love can give. Then in the third paragraph intimacy is also described 
                in a more slow, thoughtful, in the moment type of way. Where every movement in the intimate moment felt 
                like an eternal action. Then the author closes with another peaceful imagery of a quiet mundane imagery 
                of a wheat roll tumbling through the wind at night. Putting yourself in that moment you can feel the peace 
                at night, with the quiet night wrapping around you. Freedom in peace seems to be a major theme in this poem, 
                a type of peace that someone can give you who makes moments feel eternal and special. Lately, I found 
                myself feeling glimpses of this as spring comes around. Now that I finally have glasses and learning about
                 myself a bit more through therapy I’ve come to learn to really just take in the beauty of the moment in the
                  day. In that moment of admiration of the trees blossoming and the festival of animals celebrating the sun,
                   I am able to take a step back from any anxiety or draining emotions and really appreciate everything around me. 
                   So far “Veinte poemas de amor y un cancion de desesperada” has been pretty fun to read. I’ll probably do my 
                   favorite poem written by Rumi this week as well as an extra!
