            <h2>My Reflections</h2>
            <!-- Insert your journal entry text here -->
            <p>I'm trying to improve my writing a bit. Usually, I write off the top of my head without proofreading. Hopefully, this will come out cleaner. Pablo Neruda's poem "So That You Will Hear Me" is more direct compared to his other works. He recounts a time when he wishes he could be seen and understood. In the first paragraph, he discusses his words thinning, possibly indicating that he's omitting key details for some reason. He reinforces this by stating, "They are more yours than mine. They climb on my old suffering like ivy," which intensifies how he holds back his words for her. In the next paragraph, he pins this inability to communicate his emotions on her. He wants her to understand his perspective, but for some reason, she seems unable to. Another impactful line is, "You listen to other voices in my painful voice," suggesting that she may hear something deeper that even he doesn't recognize; perhaps past traumas he hasn't fully healed from, leading him to believe he's not understood because he doesn't understand himself first. The last three paragraphs are a plea for her not to give up on him, despite his struggles to communicate his feelings. It appears the author is desperate, clinging to this relationship. He repeats the line, "You occupy/fill everything," suggesting the person consumes his thoughts. This poem is quite poignant, revealing the complexity and contradictions of human emotions. While the author loves, cherishes, and seeks understanding from this person, he also selfishly blames them for not understanding him as he wishes. However, I challenge the author: perhaps he's the one who doesn't fully understand. At work, I know someone who deeply cares for a person but also blames them for ending things. It's easy to point fingers, but what could one have done better? This poem captures those desperate moments, which often lead to a better self-understanding. Sometimes, it takes someone special to shine a light on the aspects of ourselves we've avoided.
