            <h2>My Reflections</h2>
            <!-- Insert your journal entry text here -->
            <p>I'm trying to improve my writing a bit. Usually, I write off the top of my head without proofreading. Hopefully, this will come out cleaner.

                Pablo Neruda's poem "So That You Will Hear Me" is more direct compared to his other works. He recounts a time when he wishes he could be seen and understood. In the first paragraph, he discusses his words thinning, possibly indicating that he's omitting key details for some reason. He reinforces this by stating, "They are more yours than mine. They climb on my old suffering like ivy," which intensifies how he holds back his words for her.
                
                In the next paragraph, he pins this inability to communicate his emotions on her. He wants her to understand his perspective, but for some reason, she seems unable to. Another impactful line is, "You listen to other voices in my painful voice," suggesting that she may hear something deeper that even he doesn't recognize — perhaps past traumas he hasn't fully healed from, leading him to believe he's not understood because he doesn't understand himself first.
                
                The last three paragraphs are a plea for her not to give up on him, despite his struggles to communicate his feelings. It appears the author is desperate, clinging to this relationship. He repeats the line, "You occupy/fill everything," suggesting the person consumes his thoughts. This poem is quite poignant, revealing the complexity and contradictions of human emotions. While the author loves, cherishes, and seeks understanding from this person, he also selfishly blames them for not understanding him as he wishes.
                
                However, I challenge the author: perhaps he's the one who doesn't fully understand. For me at least, in the past, I was scared of being heartbroken and had very high expectations of others. Handling conflict scares me because I don’t really advocate for myself. This isn’t an excuse, yet I would have high expectations for others to just understand me, and that is unrealistic. Why should I expect someone else to carry that side for me? That’s something I’ve come to realize and begin to let go of. I can’t let my past traumas dictate my ability to advocate for myself, and I shouldn’t extend this lack of self-awareness and blame someone else for not understanding.
                <p>
                    I think one of my favorite lines is:
                    
                    “Before you they lived in the loneliness that you came to fill,
                    and they are more used to my sadness than you are.
                    Now I want them to say what I wish to tell you,
                    so that you will hear me as I want you to hear.
                    The wind of fear still sweeps them along.
                    Hurricanes in dreams sometimes still strike them down.”
                </p>
                
                With this person, I truly felt like I met my best friend. Within a few hours of talking, it was a conversation I had been looking for in someone for years. In that moment, I felt I had found someone who matched my soul. I didn’t realize how lonely I was until I met her. How seen I felt was a new feeling, one I had never experienced before.
                
                Then, when I came to find out that she didn’t live here, I was so devastated. For the longest time, I promised myself, my family, and my friends that I would never attempt long distance, and now I was stuck. This was my fault in thinking distance was the problem, it never was. I was too happy about leaving the toxic relationship that I didn’t fully process what was wrong about it. So when I found this person, the fear of heartbreak settled in. This fear was a precursor to me being unable to say the things I felt.
                
                I don’t want to go too in detail about why, how, and when I fell for her because this poem is more about introspection, but I totally understand how that fear can be paralyzing. What I just don’t agree with in this poem is that, ultimately, our traumas should not limit our love, because we end up hurting ourselves in the process.
                
                I can write a 20-page love letter to this person about everything I feel. Maybe in the upcoming poems it touches on what falling in love looks like; then maybe I’ll go more in depth. Honestly, even though I’m probably talking to a void, and maybe a part of me wishes she could read all this, I can’t force it. Although I have so much to say to her, it's all in God’s hands, and she will forever remain in my prayers. Maybe God can say hi to her for me in her dreams lol.
