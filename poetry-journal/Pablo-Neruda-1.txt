This poem speaks a lot to me. I relate to how right and almost magnetic a connection can feel with someone. The author described their relationship as her being the earth and him being the farmworker. Then due to prior traumas she was there for him but he could not manifest his love and it was too late for him when he fell in love it was too late. He was left with all this yearning caused by his indecisiveness that nothing can quench it. Dealing with someone that feels so right for you during a dark time or even a moment in your life that you are not ready to be there for him is so rough. The feeling of the what ifs hurt more than any other feeling especially with someone you love because that love could never reach the potential it should have. Right person wrong time was something I always didn’t believe because I always thought it's always the right time. However there are things I need to work on and hopefully by continuing therapy I can one day love 100% someone who made me feel the same way as she did. The yearning is still there but it's also somehow a pivotal lesson that can push me or anyone to get over things I need to get over and actually learn about ourselves in a way that we wouldn’t have noticed prior just like the author narrates.
