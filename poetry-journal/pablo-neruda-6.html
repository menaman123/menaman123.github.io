            <h2>My Reflections</h2>
            <!-- Insert your journal entry text here -->
            <p>This poem has a nostalgic vibe to it. The author is reminiscing and placing themselves back in time, remembering when they were with this person. Pablo Neruda is describing a very peaceful moment with someone who, in the poem, essentially becomes the fall season. Their soul is so peaceful that leaves are gently floating, their voice is calming and serene, and their arms are affectionately enveloping the speaker’s entire body. One can almost imagine how warm and wanted that moment felt.

                But the poem ends with this simply being a memory—like it's almost foggy—yet that warm feeling still lingers. Although the exact details are blurry, that special moment remains forever. This poem, although short, is very beautiful, especially given where I am in life right now.
                
                In the past, heartbreak used to hurt me so deeply that I would completely erase nostalgic memories like these from my mind instead of processing and celebrating the relationship. But recently, after talking to my therapist and reflecting on my most recent experience, I realized that was a bad habit. I’m scared of developing deep connections with people because I’m afraid they’ll eventually turn into memories.
                
                I end up shooting myself in the foot, but what’s always been at the top of my mind is this question: was the connection as special for them as it was for me? Since I don’t want to be hurt, I throw away the memories to protect myself from the painful possibility that it wasn’t special to them.
                
                Recently, through the help of others, I’ve been learning to cherish relationships and celebrate those connections. Connecting with people is truly rare, and I should be able to value those experiences at any point in life. I also hope that, for them, the connection was just as meaningful.
