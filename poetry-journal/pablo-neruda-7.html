            <p>I keep saying I’ll do it weekly but reading poetry is so soothing sometimes. Maybe we all go through similar feelings because I feel like if I was smart enough I could be writing things too. Too bad if I tried writing poetry it would be the most cringe worthy writing ever.

                The poem I read is Leaning into the Afternoons, which is Poem 7 by Pablo Neruda. This poem was kinda confusing so the general vibe I got from it was that it's about unrequited love or separation. Casting nets at night feels like a desperate move to get the person’s attention. Especially the line, “I send out red signals across your absent eyes,” meaning that Pablo Neruda is trying to get this person’s attention, but for whatever reason their mind is elsewhere. Yet he still tries and tries again. This is emphasized when he says again toward the end that he flings his sad nets.
                
                It seems like there's a glimmer of hope for Pablo because even at night the stars are there, shedding some light into the darkness coming off of her. I think this poem shows someone casting a net to pull someone back in even if there is no hope. I mean, think about it — a whole ocean, and then it's dark on top of it, and you're still casting a net hoping to get a glance from them. It's insane. There is also a sort of anxiety to this, like clinging on when you know you're not supposed to. Then you get flashbacks of when things were good, and maybe that’s why he keeps trying.
                
                I’ve felt like this sooo much in my life, and lately I’ve been asking my dad what it was like with him and my mom. Growing up I was super romantic but something in me changed and I kinda became cold. My dad told me that with my mom, she was recently divorced and wasn’t in the right headspace for him. The relationship even started weird, with my mom giving him her number but the last two digits were off. So what my dad did was track where the phone number was from and go to her apartment to give her coffee. My mom is crazy because she loved this, but deep down she was still grieving her previous toxic relationship. She would be so mean to my dad, saying things like “We’ll never be together,” and “I don’t like you,” etc. Yet my dad, like Pablo, kept casting a net even though my mom was distant and cold.
                
                In hindsight, when my mom told me her side, she said she found my dad very charming for those little things, but she was not ready for something with him. My dad wrote poems, dedicated songs to her, and even wrote her name on a leaf with the idea that the wind will set the leaf free and come back with her love. He did all this without telling her. All in the hopes that this would bring them together in the future. Like Pablo describes with casting a net.
                
                I grew up with these stories and I began emulating my dad. My first crush ever, I would write her love letters, and my mom would encourage it. Then my first love — I did the same, but also handcrafted gifts that were personal to her. I used the cookie box from our first date to create a memory box of all the memories we made together. But after her, I was so hurt that I rejected it all, thinking it was pointless. That led to my toxic relationship and it kinda cemented the idea that love is dead. I was so happy it ended that I didn’t feel any of the emotions I get from these poems.
                
                But I know at one point I did. And now, even though it wasn’t a boyfriend-girlfriend type relationship, I did experience a deep and special connection with this person. My emotions were clogged because I never fully processed and healed. Obviously therapy helps, but also reading these poems and talking to my parents about their love makes me remember how much I loved love and how much I miss it.
                
                I wish I was able to show that side to that person, but hindsight always looks good and I can’t do anything about the past. Maybe I’ll write their name on a leaf and that will bring my romantic side back lol.
