            <h2>My Reflections</h2>
            <!-- Insert your journal entry text here -->
            <p>This is my favorite poem ever!! The first time I read this poem I was in the middle of a campaign to help organize people into getting demands met. This poem mainly talks about oneself and not being able to fully convey one's own thoughts due to the finite set of words that exist. But for me I also thought about the people I talk to on the regular. When organizing you talk to soooo many people from different walks of life all culminating to this one point where things need to change. Their motivations behind these changes vary, and they all have their own personalities as well. You come to realize so many life experiences molds and shapes you in how you carry your life. For me the most important thing is not what you say but your thought process. There is somehow a beauty in the mechanical way someone thinks and ultimately comes to a conclusion or action. For me that is the interpreter of the fire. From synapses in your brain firing that chain together to form sentences and ultimately actions fascinate me so much. Even outside of words, someone's body language, tone, and purpose behind every word is so pretty. That is why this is my favorite poem because it highlights the complexity behind everyone’s words and actions. </p>
